1. How to run the code?
Change the settings in the hees.cfg file in the
current directory and in the command line, type

./energysys > 1

Then, you could find the final energy stored in the bank
in the file OverallProcess.txt.

2. How to change the workload?
You can specify the workload in Tasks.txt. A workload
consists of three parameters in the following format.

1.0 0.5 600
1.0 0.8 300

The first one is the voltage, you could fix it to be 1.0 (Volt).
The second one is the current, e.g. 0.5 (Amps).
The third one is the task length in seconds, e.g. 600 (Seconds).
You can play with the second and the third parameters.

3. What experiments we want to do?
We want to find if task scheduling will affect the energy stored in
the EES bank when the task duration is small, for different capacitance. 
So, you could change the capacitance and run two tasks in different order
and see if the energy stored in the bank has large difference.
