Here is how to generate training data:
We set the solor power at 3.0w, and we sweep
the task current from 0.7 to 2.0.

We make 5 sets of training data, with a step of
100, 40, 20, 10 and all less than 5.
We generate more data when the supercapacitor energy is small.
Because the energy changing slope is more steep.
