1. How to use Scheduler.cpp to generate dynamic programming based schedule to
generate schedule and baseline policy schedule.

* To compile the code:
make sched
This build the binary Scheduler

* To run the scheduler
./Scheduler 0.9
The only argument is the ratio between the deadline and all task length in nominal
speed (1.0V)

*** CAUTIONS ***
Since it will use the neural network to predict task energy, it is necessary to 
keep a set of valid nnet model under the run directory. You can use symbolic link though.
