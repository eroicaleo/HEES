0001. The neural network predictor does not work properly when input power is way out of the training range.
When the input power is very close to 0, the delta energy can be negative, which is apprantly wrong.

A: 

0002. When building the vector task voltage table, did not use the nominal current to initialize the task voltage
table. Use the power instead. This is fine in current settings, because the nominal voltage is 1.0 volt. 
So the magnitudes of power and current are the same. But it needs to be fixed.

A:
